## Abstract
Using daily ground-level ozone forecast predictions, we can allow for public health agenices to warn Beijing residents to take precautions on days with high O3 pollution. These warnings can improve the overall public health through minimization of related ramifications. Additionally, the agriculture industry may use these predictions to make decisions with plant survival in mind.
